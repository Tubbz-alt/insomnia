# insomnia
A sweet sleeping site that informs you how naps affect your mind/body. Also has an alarm clock so you can sleep immediately.

Insomnia, or nap sweetly, is my first gentle attempt at learning and doing web stuff, created 
during CalHacks 2.0 soon after a quick bit of crash course learning.

Nap sweetly is just a simple site that allows people to avoid the negative side effects of napping
improperly, e.g. sleep inertia. 

The site connects effects to nap length, e.g. increased performance and alertness is connected
to the 26-minute NASA nap originally found to be optimum for astronauts. Increased creativity and making up for sleep
deprivation is connected to the 90-minute, or full sleep cycle nap. 

A user can scroll over a nap type (power nap, sleep-deprivation countering) to see the relevant nap time, 
and click to begin the nap alarm clock.

Always in progress, as my first experimental web project. Potential future stages include cleaning up the look and design,
including pages for the science behind the info presented, user ratings, etc.
